//  MODULE:   copyhook.cpp
//
//  PURPOSE:   Implements the ICopyHook member functions necessary to support
//             the copy hook portioins of this shell extension.
//             Copy hook handlers are called each time a folder is copied, moved,
//             renamed, etc. in the system.  Note that the CopyCallback is NOT
//             called for each file, but only for entire folders.

//    dwSrcAttribs  - file attributes of the source file
//    pszDestFile   - name of the destiation file (for move and renames)
